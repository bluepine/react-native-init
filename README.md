      	```

# Get Started

1.  ## :arrow_down: Installation
    Fire command prompt and run following commands :
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/teallabs/react-native-init
    $ cd react-native-init && npm install
    ```
2.  ## Project Name & Bundle Id change

    We recommend you renaming your _project-name_ & _bundle-id_, as this would be essential for your whole project configuration. Following steps will help you rename your project :

    - Install [react-native-rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename)
      `npm install react-native-rename -g`
    - For renaming app :
      `react-native-rename <newName>`
    - For changing bundle id :
      `// For Android react-native-rename <newName> -b <bundleIdentifier> //For iOS Open project in Xcode, Go to General tab and change Bundle Identifier`
      ![bundle-id](https://image.ibb.co/kSBQnS/Bundle_Id_IOS.png)

3.  ## :clipboard: Documentation :clipboard:

    To get this project running with all dependencies, follow steps given below :

    1.  ## Google Signin

        We are using [react-native-google-signin](https://github.com/devfd/react-native-google-signin) for Google Signin. For user authentication and push notification we will be using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). First we setup our firebase app for both platforms.

        - Create a new [account](https://firebase.google.com/) / Log in to your [account](https://firebase.google.com/)
        - Create a new project with required information

        ### Generate Release/Debug keystores

        Fire up console in your project folder and run following command :

        ```
        // For Debug
        keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

        // For Release
        keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
        ```

        > Move the .keystore file generated to android/app folder.

        Your _gradle.properties_ file in _android / app_ should have following settings. The _store and key password_ should be same as what you entered while creating Release keystore file.

        ```
        MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD= /* Password of release keystore */
        MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD= /* Enter password here*/
        ```

        Configure Firebase project for both android and iOS app individually.
        First we will start with setting up firebase for android app.


    	1.  **Android**
    	You will be needing  _Bundle Identifier_ from _build.gradle_ in next step.

    	```
    	ProjectName
    	|_ android
    	|_ _ app
    	|_ _ _ build.gradle
    	```
    	![build.gradle](https://image.ibb.co/hk8Nz7/Bundle_Id_Android.png)

    	Enter bundle id from build.gradle to add firebase to android app. Register App and skip rest of the steps.
    	![firebase android](https://image.ibb.co/cdYY6n/Android_Fire.png)

    	You need to generate SHA-1 and add the generated fingerprint to your firebase config for android app.
    	```
    	Run following commands in project-name > android > app

    	// For Debug
    	keytool -list -v -keystore debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
    	// For Release
    	keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -storepass [storepass] -keypass [keypass]
    	```




    	Go to Firebase > Project Settings ![enter SHA](https://image.ibb.co/hY3t6n/Screen_Shot_2018_04_18_at_1_10_11_PM.png)



    	After adding both SHA-1 fingerprint of Debug and Release download _google-services.json_ file and replace it with your *android/app/google-services.json file.*

    	2.  **iOS**

    	Add new iOS app in your Firebase project.<br/>  

    	You will get bundle identifier from Xcode / General tab. Register and skip other steps.
    	![bundle-id](https://image.ibb.co/kSBQnS/Bundle_Id_IOS.png)


    	Once done registering app, download and open the *GoogleService-Info.plist* file.

    	Open Xcode and switch to Info tab. You need to give _url types_ which we will get from *GoogleService-Info.plist* file.


    	Get Bundle Id and Reverse Client Id from *GoogleService-Info.plist* file. Enter respective fields in Xcode.

    	![bundleid](https://image.ibb.co/i2dm97/Bundle_IDReverser.png)

    	Navigate to *App.js* file and change *iosClientId* in *hasPlayServices* and uncomment that line.<br/>



    	![hasplayServices](https://image.ibb.co/e2BChS/ClientID.png)



    	For more configuration in Google Signin, follow instructions from [React-Native-Google-Signin](https://github.com/devfd/react-native-google-signin) .
    2.  ## OneSignal
    	[OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) provides a simple interface to push notifications and email.
    	* Create an account [here](https://onesignal.com/)
    	* Add a new app

    	First we will configure for android app,
    	1. **Android**
    	Open your [firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com) and switch to Cloud Messaging tab and copy Google Server API Key, Google Project Number for configuring android app.
    		![cloud messaging](https://image.ibb.co/i3HPwn/One_Signal_Android.png)


    		Now switch to code editor and make changes as suggested below.

    		```
    		// Navigate here

    		ProjectName
    		|_ android
    		|_ _ app
    		|_ _ _ build.gradle
    		```

    		![onesignal app id](https://image.ibb.co/bFQG97/One_Singal_Code_Android.png)

    		2. **iOS**

    			For iOS, you will be prompted to give .p12 file. Read from [here].(https://support.magplus.com/hc/en-us/articles/203808748-iOS-Creating-a-Distribution-Certificate-and-p12-File) how to get .p12 file
    			When you are done with configuring iOS project
    		* Now open *AppDelegate.m* in code editor and change *oneSignalAppId* with the one you get on creating a new app on Onesignal platform.
    			```
    			ProjectName
    			|_ ios
    			|_ _ ProjectName
    			|_ _ _ AppDelegate.m
    			```



    			![oneSignalAppId](https://image.ibb.co/hjDYNS/IOSOne_Signal.png)
    3.  ## Sentry
    	[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) provides open source error tracking that shows you every crash in your stack as it happens, with the details needed to prioritize, identify, reproduce, and fix each issue.

    	* Create your account [here](https://sentry.io/signup) / Login [here](https://sentry.io/auth/login/)
    	* Add a new project
    	* Once you are done creating project open *sentry.properties* file from both android and iOS folder.
    	* You have to change Organization name, Project name and auth token.
    		```
    		// Navigate here

    		ProjectName
    		|_ android
    		|_ _ app
    		|_ _ _ sentry.properties
    		|
    		|_ _ ios
    		|_ _ _ sentry.properties
    		```



    	![onesignal](https://image.ibb.co/n1qUwn/Screen_Shot_2018_04_18_at_2_57_37_PM.png)

    	In project settings, you can see your project name written in lower case. Use it for above configuration.

    	You can get your organization name from organization settings which is written in lower case.

    	Migrate [here](https://sentry.io/api) to get _auth.token_ :point_up:

    	Now open *index.js* and change *ADD_SENTRY_CLIENT_KEY* from DSN(Legacy/Deprecated)

    	![sentry DSN](https://image.ibb.co/cRym97/Sentry_DSN.png)

    4.  ## Code Push

    	[CodePush](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push) is a cloud service that enables React Native developers to deploy mobile app updates instantly to their user's devices. Following steps will help in configuring CodePush for project.
    	1. Install CodePush CLI
    		```
    		npm install -g code-push-cli
    		```
    	2. Create/Login a CodePush account
    		```
    		// Register
    		> code-push register
    		// Login if registered already
    		> code-push login
    		```
    	3. Register your app
    		If your app targets both iOS and Android, we highly recommend creating separate apps with CodePush. One for each platform.

    		```
    		// For Android
    		> code-push app add <App-Name-Android> android react-native

    		// For iOS
    		> code-push app add <App-Name-Ios> ios react-native
    		```
    		**For Android**

    		```
    		> code-push deployment ls <App-Name-Android> --displayKeys
    		```
    		Copy both Debug and Release key in *build.gradle* in
    		```
    		ProjectName
    		|_android
    		|_ _ app
    		|_ _ _ build.gradle
    		```
    		![codepush android](https://image.ibb.co/g83Ewn/Android_Code_Push.png)

    		**For iOS**
    		```
    		> code-push deployment ls <App-Name-Ios> --displayKeys
    		```

    		![codepush-ios](https://preview.ibb.co/fH1EU7/Code_Push_Ios_1.png)
    		Note : Change CODEPUSH_KEYs with keys we get from above command.

# :clapper: Start project

You are now all set to start your project !

```
// For iOS
> react-native run-ios

// For Android
> react-native run-android
```

# :office: Build your app :office:

When your app is ready to ship, you need to individially build _.apk_ and _.ipa_ file for android and iOS respectively.

For **Android**,

```
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The final apk would be generated in

```
ProjectName
|_android
|_ _ app
|_ _ _ build
|_ _ _ _ outputs
|_ _ _ _ _ apk
|_ _ _ _ _ _ app-release.apk
```

For **iOS**,
It's a long process to build _.ipa_ file for App Store. We will be adding a detailed procedure for this in [wiki](https://github.com/teallabs/react-native-init/wiki) shortly. Meanwhile, you can follow this awesome [blog](https://medium.com/react-native-development/deploying-a-react-native-app-for-ios-pt-1-a79dfd15acb8).
